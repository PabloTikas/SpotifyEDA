This is a typical exploratory data analysis (EDA) project. The dataset used contains the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2023.

Project's objectives:
- Data cleaning & pre-processing.
- Descriptive statistics.
- Visualization.

Key findings:
- Released date matters.
- Emotional features like danceability, valence (positive tone), and energy are key drivers of both popularity and engagement.
- Musical features like tempo (bpm), acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, and speechiness play more nuanced roles.
- Tracks in major modes and specific keys (C#, D, F#, B) tend to perform better.
